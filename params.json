{"name":"The Girls Dashboard","tagline":"Dashing.io and Beyond The Whiteboard CrossFit WOD Dashboard","body":"# The Girls Dashboard\r\n\r\nDashboard application useful for showcasing [CrossFit](http://journal.crossfit.com) WOD results using data from [Beyond The Whiteboard](http://beyondthewhiteboard.com) and powered by [Dashing.io](http://dashing.io).\r\n\r\n## Setup / Install\r\n\r\n### 1. Define the following environment variables:\r\n\r\n* BTWB_USERNAME\r\n* BTWB_PASSWORD\r\n* BTWB_BOX (1-example-crossfit)\r\n\r\n### 2. Determine which Girls and Heros you want to highlight by editing the following YAML files:\r\n\r\n* girls.yml\r\n* heros.yml\r\n\r\n### 3. Setup and Deploy to Heroku as instructed at [Dashing.io](http://shopify.github.com/dashing).\r\n\r\nThe Girls Dashboard needs your login credentials in order to query BTWB information specific to your box.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nI built The Girls Dashboard for [SnoRidge CrossFit](http://srcf.joecode.com). I've configured the dashboard to work best on a 1080p LCD display.
